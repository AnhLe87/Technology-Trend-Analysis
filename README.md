# Technology-Trend-Analysis
*Using Stack Overflow Developer Survey Data*
## Project overview
This project analyzes technology trends in the software development industry using data from the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). The goal is to uncover patterns and answer key questions about programming languages, frameworks, databases, tools, and developer demographics over time.

## Research Questions
The analysis aims to answer the following questions:
1. **Programming Languages**
   - Which programming languages are the most popular among developers?
   - Which languages have been growing or declining in popularity over the years?

2. **Frameworks & Libraries**
   - Which frameworks are most commonly used in development projects?
   - Are there any emerging frameworks gaining adoption rapidly?

3. **Databases & Cloud Platforms**
   - Which database technologies are preferred by developers?
   - What is the trend in cloud platform usage (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)?

4. **Developer Demographics**
   - What are the most common job roles and experience levels?
   - How do developer preferences vary by region?

5. **Career & Job Satisfaction**
   - What factors influence developer job satisfaction?
   - How does salary vary across countries, roles, and technologies?
